CaDiCaL_PriPro
===============================================================================

CaDiCaL_PriPro is a hack of CaDiCaL v1.4.0 and debuted in the SAT
Competition 2021. It introduced the novel idea of Priority Propagation.

The binary created by the build process is still called `cadical`
despite being CaDiCaL_PriPro.  Use `./configure && make` to configure
and build `cadical` and the library `libcadical.a` in the default
`build` sub-directory.  The header file of the library is
[`src/cadical.hpp`](src/cadical.hpp) and includes an example for API
usage.
  
See [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) for options and more details related to the build
process and [`test/README.md`](test/README.md) for testing the library and
the solver.

The solver has the following usage `cadical [ dimacs [ proof ] ]`.
See `cadical -h` for more options.
