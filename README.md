CaDiCaL_PriPro
===============================================================================

CaDiCaL_PriPro is a hack of CaDiCaL v1.4.0 and debuted in the SAT
Competition 2021. It introduced the novel idea of Priority Propagation
and won the "[Special Innovation
Price](https://satcompetition.github.io/2021/slides/ISC2021-fixed.pdf)"
awarded at the [SAT Competition
2021](https://satcompetition.github.io/2021/). The version available
here is the one used in the competition. A later version of
CaDiCaL_PriPro containing minor bug fixes and improvements, which served
as a basis for the publication "[Prioritised Unit Propagation by
Partitioning the Watch Lists](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3545/paper2.pdf)"
(for BibTex see below) on Priority Propagation, is going to be released
in the coming weeks (as of June 2024).

The binary created by the build process is still called `cadical`
despite being CaDiCaL_PriPro. Use `./configure && make` to configure
and build `cadical` and the library `libcadical.a` in the default
`build` sub-directory. The header file of the library is
[`src/cadical.hpp`](src/cadical.hpp) and includes an example for API
usage.

See [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) for options and more details related to the build
process and [`test/README.md`](test/README.md) for testing the library and
the solver.

The solver has the following usage `cadical [ dimacs [ proof ] ]`.
See `cadical -h` for more options.
